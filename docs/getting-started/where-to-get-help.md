# Where to Get Help

If you’re stuck, there are a number of places you can get help:

## The Official Crew Website

The Official Crew website is always a great place to visit. It features links to oft-used developer tools, community plugins, and guides on using crew.

## The IRC Channel

IRC Channel on irc.freenode.net:

- #crew – General Discussion

If you’re stumped, give us a holler in the Crew IRC channel. Someone from the development team is usually there, especially during the daylight hours for North and South America users. We’d love to hear from you, whether you need some help, want to find users in your area, or would like to donate your brand new sports car.
